# python-recipes

Notebooks for common python scientific recipes used in the UCL-GERU lab. This repository is public. The philosophy is to publish recipes focused on environmental data analysis mainly for hydrological purpose. 

Hence, the aim is not to provide general tutorials about python. Though, for newcomers and interrested visitors, a learning path and link to useful resources are shared at the end of this readme.

# Python - Getting started

## Choose your environment

Here are the most popular Python environments for scientific programming.

* [Python (x,y)](https://python-xy.github.io/): Integrated Python Scientific Environment
* [Enthought Canopy]: Integrated Python Scientific Environment
* [Anaconda](https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy/): Integrated Python Scientific Environment
* [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/): Browser based environment for generating interactive notebook
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - Professional Python Environment for developpers

Jupyter is included in Anaconda and Enthought Canopy. Anaconda is particularly handy if you plan to deal with virtual python environments. PyCharm is not a scientific environment but it will be particularly useful if you plan to package your code. PyCharm does not include any Python distribution.
